    TODO But in a real-world example, you will need to use a dependency that also allows you to version your database
     scripts. I recommend you look at Flyway (https://flywaydb.org/) and Liquibase
     (https://www.liquibase.org/). These are two highly appreciated dependencies for database
     schema versioning.
        Maybe check these tools out
